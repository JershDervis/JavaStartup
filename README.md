# JavaStartup
A java library for Installing a File to multiple operating system startups

This project is currently a work in progress. So far the library has the options to Install a file to:
* Windows
  * Registry
    * LOCAL_MACHINE
    * CURRENT_USER
  * Startup Folder
    * LOCAL_MACHINE
    * CURRENT_USER
    
I am currently working on support for Mac and Linux operating systems.
